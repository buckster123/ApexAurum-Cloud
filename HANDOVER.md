## TDZ Bug Fixes (`7403f32`)

**Problem:** After login, navbar disappeared. Console showed `Cannot access 'O' before initialization`.

**Root Causes Found & Fixed:**

1. **api.js Line 35** - Token refresh used bare `axios.post()` instead of the configured `api` instance. This meant refresh requests hit the frontend domain (no baseURL) instead of backend. **Fixed:** Now uses `api.post()`.

2. **App.vue Lines 13-19** - pacMode watcher with `immediate: true` ran during component setup, causing TDZ in minified code. **Fixed:** Removed `immediate: true`, apply initial state synchronously.

3. **ChatView.vue** - `loadBranchInfo()` was defined at line 380, but the watcher calling it with `immediate: true` was at line 227. **Fixed:** Moved function definition BEFORE the watcher.

## Billing System (was working)

### Fixes Applied Today

1. **Customer ID Validation** (`fa53408`)
   - Customer creation now raises errors instead of returning fake IDs
   - Added `_ensure_valid_stripe_customer()` that validates before checkout
   - Auto-creates new Stripe customer if ID is invalid

2. **Automatic Tax Fix** (`8db10c0`)
   - Added `customer_update={"address": "auto"}` for Stripe Tax
   - Saves billing address from checkout to customer record

3. **Success Redirect Fix** (`771c32c`)
   - Changed from localhost to HTTPS production URL
   - Now redirects to `frontend-production-5402.up.railway.app/billing/success`

4. **Railway Start Command**
   - Removed custom `cd /app && ...` start command that was breaking deploys
   - Now uses Dockerfile CMD

5. **Tools Count** (`a5025e5`)
   - Fixed hardcoded "(6)" in sidebar to show actual tool count (46)

## Known Issues

### ChatView Console Error
```
Cannot access 'H' before initialization
```
- This is a minification/bundling issue in Vite
- Doesn't seem to break functionality
- Needs investigation in build process

### Neural Page CORS Errors
- Browser shows CORS errors but backend CORS is configured correctly
- Likely caused by ad blocker or WebGL context failure
- WebGL not supported on user's current browser/hardware

---

## Stripe Config Status

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Secret Key | ✅ Set |
| Publishable Key | ✅ Set |
| Webhook Secret | ✅ Set |
| Pro Price (recurring) | ✅ Fixed |
| Opus Price (recurring) | ✅ Fixed |
| Credit Pack 500 | ❌ Not created |
| Credit Pack 2500 | ❌ Not created |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Create credit pack prices** in Stripe (optional)
2. **Test webhook** - verify `checkout.session.completed` updates subscription
3. **Test tier features** - verify model/tool restrictions work per tier
4. **Investigate ChatView error** - low priority, doesn't break functionality

---

## Quick Verification

1. **Check health:**
   ```bash
   curl https://backend-production-507c.up.railway.app/health | jq '{build, features: .features[-3:]}'
   ```

2. **Test pricing (public):**
   ```bash
   curl https://backend-production-507c.up.railway.app/api/v1/billing/pricing | jq
   ```

3. **Login and test checkout:**
   - Go to https://frontend-production-5402.up.railway.app
   - Login → Navigate to Billing → Click "Upgrade" on Pro tier
   - Should redirect to Stripe checkout (or show better error message)

## Session Summary: Billing & Monetization System

### What Was Accomplished

Implemented the complete billing and monetization infrastructure for ApexAurum:

1. **Database Models** (`app/models/billing.py`)
   - `Subscription` - Stripe subscription sync (tier, status, usage)

2. **Configuration** (`app/config.py`)
   - Stripe environment variables (secret key, publishable key, webhook secret)
   - Price IDs for subscriptions and credit packs
   - `TIER_LIMITS` dict with tier features and limits
   - `CREDIT_PACKS` dict with credit pack pricing

3. **Services**
   - `app/services/pricing.py` - LLM cost calculation per provider/model
   - `app/services/billing.py` - BillingService for usage tracking and Stripe integration

4. **API Endpoints** (`app/api/v1/billing.py`)
   - `GET /api/v1/billing/status` - Get user's billing status

## Previous Session: Multi-Provider LLM Implementation

### What Was Accomplished

Implemented the full multi-provider LLM system as planned in `.claude/plans/rippling-whistling-chipmunk.md`:

1. **Backend Provider Registry & Service** (`llm_provider.py`)
   - `PROVIDERS` dict with 5 providers: Anthropic, DeepSeek, Groq, Together AI, Qwen
   - `PROVIDER_MODELS` dict with models per provider
   - `MultiProviderLLM` class with unified `chat()` and `chat_stream()` methods
   - Tool format conversion between Anthropic and OpenAI formats
   - Anthropic uses native SDK, others use OpenAI SDK with different base URLs

2. **Backend API Endpoints** (modified `chat.py`)
   - `GET /api/v1/chat/providers` - List available providers with status
   - `GET /api/v1/chat/models?provider=X` - Get models for a provider
   - Modified `ChatRequest` to accept `provider` field
   - Modified `send_message` to use `MultiProviderLLM`

3. **Frontend Provider State** (modified `chat.js`)
   - `selectedProvider` ref with localStorage persistence
   - `availableProviders` ref
   - `fetchProviders()` action
   - `setProvider()` action that refreshes models
   - `sendMessage()` now includes provider

4. **Frontend Provider Selector UI** (modified `ChatView.vue`)
   - Provider dropdown appears in sidebar when `devMode` is active
   - Shows provider availability (no key = disabled)
   - Displays "Uses your BYOK key" for Anthropic, "Uses platform API key" for others

### Provider Details

| Provider | Base URL | Env Var |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Anthropic | native SDK | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (BYOK) |
| DeepSeek | `https://api.deepseek.com` | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` |
| Groq | `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` | `GROQ_API_KEY` |
| Together | `https://api.together.xyz/v1` | `TOGETHER_API_KEY` |
| Qwen | `https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1` | `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` |

### Files Created/Modified

**Backend:**
- `app/services/llm_provider.py` - NEW: Multi-provider LLM service
- `app/api/v1/chat.py` - MODIFIED: Added provider endpoints
- `app/main.py` - MODIFIED: Updated build version

**Frontend:**

## Architecture Summary

```
Frontend (ChatView.vue)
├── Provider Selector (devMode only)
├── Model Selector (per provider)
└── sends { provider, model, message }

Backend (chat.py)
├── GET /providers → list with availability
├── GET /models?provider= → models for provider
└── POST /message → uses MultiProviderLLM

MultiProviderLLM (llm_provider.py)
├── anthropic → Anthropic SDK (native)
└── others → OpenAI SDK (different base_url)
```
